##tecnorita
_tecnorita_ is an IRC bot written in JavaScript using [node.js](http://nodejs.org). It is designed to be extensible and powerful for anyone in the channels it occupies, allowing users to utilize and compose a collection of basic commands to form new commands.

This project is still very much a work in progress and will likely change significantly.

##Usage
Coming soon!

##Installation
Simply clone this repo, `npm install` to get the dependencies, then create a `config.js` for your particular setup. There is a sample config provided in this repo. You will need a [redis](http://redis.io/) server to connect to which will be used to store custom commands and words the bot has 'learned'. After these things have been setup, you can run the bot by simply doing:
```
node index.js
```
